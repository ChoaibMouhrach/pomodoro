## Definition

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as "pomodoros". The goal is to use the time during the pomodoros to focus on a specific task, and then take a break before starting another pomodoro. The idea is that frequent breaks can improve mental agility and make it easier to focus on tasks for longer periods of time.
